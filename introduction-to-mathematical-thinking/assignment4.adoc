== 1

Build a truth table to prove the claim I made earlier that φ ⇔ ψ is true if φ and ψ are both true
or both false, and φ ⇔ ψ is false if exactly one of φ, ψ is true and the other false. (To constitute
a proof, your table should have columns that show how the entries for φ ⇔ ψ are derived, one
operator at a time.)

|===
| stem:[psi] | stem:[phi] | stem:[psi => phi] | stem:[phi => psi] | stem:[phi => psi ^^ psi => phi]
| T | T | T | T | T
| T | F | F | T | F
| F | T | T | F | F
| F | F | T | T | T

== 2

Build a truth table to show that +
(φ ⇒ ψ) ⇔ (¬φ ∨ ψ) +
is true for all truth values of φ and ψ. A statement whose truth values are all T is called a logical
validity, or sometimes a tautology

|===
| stem:[phi] | stem:[psi] | stem:[ neg phi] | stem:[phi => psi] | stem:[ neg phi vv psi ] |
stem:[(psi => phi) => (neg phi vv psi)] | stem:[(psi => phi) <= (neg phi vv psi)] |
stem:[(psi => phi) <=> (neg phi vv psi)]
| T | T | F | T | T | T | T | T

latexmath:[(\phi \nRightarrow \psi) \Leftrightarrow (\phi \wedge \neg \psi)] +
is a tautology. +

The ancient Greeks formulated a basic rule of reasoning for proving mathematical statements.
Called modus ponens, it says that if you know φ and you know φ ⇒ ψ, then you can conclude ψ. +
(a) Construct a truth table for the logical statement +
stem:[phi ^^ (phi => psi) => psi] +


|===
| stem:[phi] | stem:[psi] | stem:[ phi => psi ] | stem:[phi ^^ (phi => psi)] |
stem:[phi ^^ (phi => psi) => psi]
| T | T | T | T | T
| T | F | F | F | T
| F | T | T | F | T
| F | F | T | F | T
|===

(b) Explain how the truth table you obtain demonstrates that modus ponens is a valid rule of
inference.

The cases were we know both stem:[phi] and stem:[phi => psi] are true are given on the 1st line. On
the other lines one of them is false (i.e. we don't know one of them). In those cases stem:[psi] is
either true or false and we can't say which one it is. But on the first line, where both
stem:[phi] and stem:[phi => psi], are true there is no ambiguity.

== 5

Provide an analogous logical argument to show that ¬(φ ∨ ψ) and (¬φ) ∧ (¬ψ) are equivalent.

. stem:[phi vv psi] means at least one of stem:[phi] or stem:[psi] is true
. Then stem:[neg(phi vv psi)] means it's not the case that at least one of stem:[phi] or stem:[psi]
is true.
. So the only case where stem:[neg(phi vv psi)] is true will be when stem:[psi] and stem:[phi] are both false.
. Which means that stem:[neg psi ^^ neg phi] is true.

== 6

By a denial of a statement φ we mean any statement equivalent to ¬φ. Give a useful (and hence
natural sounding) denial of each of the following statements.

(a) 34,159 is a prime number. +
_34,159 is not a prime number_

(b) Roses are red and violets are blue. +
_Rose are not red or violets are not blue. (Maybe 'Roses are neither red nor blue'?)_

(c) If there are no hamburgers, I’ll have a hot dog. +
_If there are no hamburgers, I won't have a hot dog._

(d) Fred will go but he will not play. +
_Fred will go and he will play._

(e) The number x is either negative or greater than 10. +
_The number x is neither negative nor greater than 10._

(f) We will win the first game or the second. +
_We will not win the first game nor the second. (Same as 'we will not win the first game and not the
second' in colloqial English)_
